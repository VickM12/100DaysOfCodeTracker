### Day 5/100
##Looking to the future
Today I spent the day thinking about and and planning my final project for General Assembly. I'd love to create an app similar to UnTappd but for whiskey/whisky. After looking for a whiskey api, i found the following project:
https://github.com/WhiskeyProject/whiskey-api

Although I haven't learned Python, I was amazed a bit that I could actually read and understand the code. There were models for users and each whiskey's profile. Users could rate and comment or describe a whiskey and use keywords that were compiled from a scraper that scoured thousands of reviews for different whiskeys and selected some choice descriptors. I'm very excited to start working on this apps. Cheers!
