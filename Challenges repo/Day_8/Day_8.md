# Day 8 / 100
## Whiskeyd Away
As my time with General Assembly comes to an end we are in teh days of final projects. All the lessons are coming together as I build an app that will allow users to track and rate whiskeys they've had. The goal will be to be able to upload pictures as well. I'm using Ruby on Rails for the backend and API with React serving up the front end. Although I hit panic mode many times when creating React apps, this time I'm more comfortable using hooks for useState and setState. I guess I really did learn something during this intense 13 week bootcamp.
