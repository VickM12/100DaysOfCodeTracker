# Day 13

## Authentication
I got authentication fully up and running with users being able to log into their profiles.

## Nav Bar
I tried to make a NavBar component with a router and links to login, register, and submit new whiskeys, but I couldn't get the pathways right so i scrapped that idea and just built out a div. I also managed to incorporate conditional rendering so the different options appear and dissappear based on whether a user is logged in or not.
